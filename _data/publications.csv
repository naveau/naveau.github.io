One powerful method for the investigation of functional connectivity is independent component analysis (ICA) of concatenated data. However, this research field is evolving toward processing increasingly larger database taking into account inter-individual variability. Concatenated data analysis only handles these features using some additional procedures such as bootstrap or including a model of between-subject variability during the preprocessing step of the ICA. In order to alleviate these limitations, we propose a method based on group analysis of individual ICA components, using a multi-scale clustering (MICCA). MICCA start with two steps repeated several times: 1) single subject data ICA followed by 2) clustering of all subject independent components according to a spatial similarity criterion. A final third step consists in selecting reproducible clusters across the repetitions of the two previous steps. The core of the innovation lies in the multi-scale and unsupervised clustering algorithm built as a chain of three processes: robust proto-cluster creation, aggregation of the proto-clusters, and cluster consolidation. We applied MICCA to the analysis of 310 fMRI resting state dataset. MICCA identified 28 resting state brain networks. Overall, the cluster neuroanatomical substrate included 98% of the cerebrum gray matter. MICCA results proved to be reproducible in a random splitting of the data sample and more robust than the classical concatenation method.","2012/03/18","2015-03-24 14:27:57","2015-06-04 13:47:30","2015-03-24 14:27:57","269-285","","3","10","","Neuroinform","","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","","","/home/naveau/.mozilla/firefox/h7x03sa5.default/zotero/storage/AXZKFMM5/Naveau et al_2012_A Novel Group ICA Approach Based on Multi-scale Individual Component Clustering.pdf; ; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22426994; http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12021-012-9145-2","","Adolescent; Adult; Bioinformatics; Brain; Brain Mapping; Clustering; Cohort; Computational Biology/Bioinformatics; Computer Appl. in Life Sciences; Databases, Factual; Female; fMRI; Functional connectivity; Humans; ICA; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Multi-scale; Neurology; Neurosciences; Oxygen; Principal Component Analysis; Reproducibility of Results; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Unsupervised; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the use of independent component analysis (ICA) of each individual fMRI signal and classification of the ICA-defined components across subjects, a set of 23 resting-state networks (RNs) was identified. Functional connectivity between each pair of RNs was assessed using temporal correlation analyses in the 0.01- to 0.1-Hz frequency band, and the corresponding set of correlation coefficients was used to obtain a hierarchical clustering of the 23 RNs. At the highest hierarchical level, we found two anticorrelated systems in charge of intrinsic and extrinsic processing, respectively. At a lower level, the intrinsic system appears to be partitioned in three modules that subserve generation of spontaneous thoughts (M1a; default mode), inner maintenance and manipulation of information (M1b), and cognitive control and switching activity (M1c), respectively. The extrinsic system was found to be made of two distinct modules: one including primary somatosensory and auditory areas and the dorsal attentional network (M2a) and the other encompassing the visual areas (M2b). Functional connectivity analyses revealed that M1b played a central role in the functioning of the intrinsic system, whereas M1c seems to mediate exchange of information between the intrinsic and extrinsic systems.","juin 01 , 2011","2012-01-09 08:44:44","2012-01-09 19:19:27","2012-01-09 08:44:44","2753 -2763","","6","105","","","Brain activity at rest","","","","","","","","","","","","Highwire 2.0","0000","","","; ; ","; ; http://jn.physiology.org/content/105/6/2753","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

New resting-state functional connectivity techniques allow us to highlight synchronization of large-scale networks, such as the default-mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN). A large body of work suggests that disruption of these networks could give rise to specific schizophrenia symptoms. We examined the intra-network connectivity strength and gray matter content (GMC) of DMN and SN in 26 schizophrenia patients using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and voxel-based morphometry. Resting-state data were analyzed with independent component analysis and dual-regression techniques. We reported reduced functional connectivity within both DMN and SN in patients with schizophrenia. Concerning the DMN, patients showed weaker connectivity in a cluster located in the right paracingulate cortex. Moreover, patients showed decreased GMC in this cluster. With regard to the SN, patients showed reduced connectivity in the left and right striatum. Decreased connectivity in the paracingulate cortex was correlated with difficulties in abstract thinking. The connectivity decrease in the left striatum was correlated with delusion and depression scores. Correlation between the connectivity of DMN frontal regions and difficulties in abstract thinking emphasizes the link between negative symptoms and the likely alteration of the frontal medial cortex in schizophrenia. Correlation between the connectivity of SN striatal regions and delusions supports the aberrant salience hypothesis. This work provides new insights into dysfunctional brain organization in schizophrenia and its contribution to specific schizophrenia symptoms.","August 2013","2015-03-24 14:26:27","2015-06-04 13:47:44","2015-03-24 14:26:27","74-80","","1–3","148","","Schizophrenia Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","; ; ; /home/naveau/.mozilla/firefox/h7x03sa5.default/zotero/storage/7UNAA7WU/S0920996413002624.html","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920996413002624/pdfft?md5=e1db9e76bcd3c1e3c3e2f7bffbc00967&pid=1-s2.0-S0920996413002624-main.pdf; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23727217; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23727217","","Adult; Brain; Cingulate; Dysconnectivity; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Neurological; Neural Pathways; Oxygen; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Psychosis; Regression Analysis; Rest; schizophrenia; Striatum","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although this rich inner experience occupies a large portion of the time spent awake, how it relates to brain activity has not been well explored. Here, we report the results of a behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of the continuous resting state in 307 healthy participants. The analysis focused on the relationship between the nature of inner experience and the temporal correlations computed between the low-frequency blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fluctuations (0.01–0.1&#xa0;Hz) of five large-scale modules. The subjects' self-reported time spontaneously spent on visual mental imagery and/or inner language was used as the behavioral variable. Decreased temporal correlations between modules were revealed when subjects reported more time spent thinking in mental images and inner language. These changes segregated the three modules supporting inner-oriented activities from those associated with sensory-related and externally guided activities. Among the brain areas associated with inner-oriented processing, the module including the lateral parietal and frontal regions (commonly described as being engaged in the manipulation and maintenance of internal information) was implicated in the majority of these effects. The preponderance of segregation appears to be the signature of the spontaneous sequence of thoughts during rest that are not constrained by logic, causality, or even a rigorous temporal organization. In other words, though goal-directed tasks have been demonstrated to rely on specific regional integration, mind wandering can be characterized by widespread modular segregation. Overall, the present study provides evidence that modulation of spontaneous low-frequency fluctuations in the brain is at least partially explained by spontaneous conscious cognition while at rest.","février 15, 2012","2012-01-03 16:15:52","2012-01-03 18:52:49","2012-01-03 16:15:52","3194-3200","","4","59","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","0000","","","; ","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MiamiImageURL&_cid=272508&_user=1574682&_pii=S1053811911013413&_check=y&_origin=&_coverDate=15-Feb-2012&view=c&wchp=dGLzVlS-zSkzV&md5=352f40f7ee588133a80da444d233aa49/1-s2.0-S1053811911013413-main.pdf; http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811911013413","","Functional connectivity; Inner language; Mind wandering; Resting state; Visual mental imagery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
